# My First GitHub Repository

This repository contains my thoughts and reflections on my greatest fear. It includes a Markdown file with a personal narrative and some of my thoughts on overcoming fear.

1. **God** -       I fear not living up to God's expectations for me.
2. **My Parents** -    I fear disappointing my parents and not fulfilling their hopes for me.
3. **Dogs** -       I have a fear of dogs, stemming from a past experience.
4. **Death** -      I fear the unknown aspects of death.
5. **Not being the child God had planned for me** -  I worry that I'm not living the life God intended for me.
