## Fear of Failure

Failure is something that haunts me every day. I worry that I won’t reach my full potential or live up to the expectations others have for me.

### Why it scares me
- It affects my career, making me question my abilities.
- It impacts my relationship with my family, as I fear I may disappoint them.
- It also strains my relationship with God, as I fear not fulfilling His plan for me.
- It makes me second-guess my decisions, which causes anxiety and doubt.

### Coping with Failure
- **Not trying every day** is my biggest fear.
- I constantly struggle with the thought of **not being good enough**.
- I'm afraid I won't become the man my father hopes me to be.

**Conclusion**: Overcoming this fear is something I strive for every day. But deep down, I know I can't do it all by myself. 
That’s when God comes into my life, guiding me through my fears and giving me the strength to keep going.
